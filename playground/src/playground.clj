  "
    So multiline comments being a form is kind of goofy, hilarious, and not too
  unexpected.

  INTERESTING:
    :namedWhatever are keywords(denoted as such by beginning with :), and are
  identifiers that evaluate to themselves(for very fast equality tests, so
  they're useful for replacing constant strings). {:key 123} is a map which maps
  the key/keyword `:key` to the value `123`. similar to {'key': 1} in javascript
  in at least usage afaik.

    Experiment with thread-last macro(->>)
