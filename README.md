# Clojure Code  for Learning

These are my musings, exercises, and solutions for the book, [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/).

I've recently wanted to learn a LISP family language so I'm pretty excited to experiment with, and learn Clojure. 

This repository will also, eventually, contain ClojureScript examples, and clojure-ish related tests.
