# Exercises for Clojure for the Brave and True

These are my solutions for the book, [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/).

I've recently wanted to learn a LISP family language so I'm pretty excited to experiment with, and learn Clojure. Having said that, there will be pretty much no reason to keep an eye on this repository as it's only for my benefit.

I may also add ClojureScript examples here, and clojure-ish related tests.
